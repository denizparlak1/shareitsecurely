## API Documentation Setup

To set up API documentation for your NestJS application, follow the steps below:

1. **Install necessary packages**:
   First, you need to install the `@nestjs/swagger` and `swagger-ui-express` packages. If your application uses Fastify, you should install `fastify-swagger` instead.
   ```bash
   npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
   ```

2. **Set up Swagger in your `main.ts`**:
   Add the following code to your `main.ts` file to set up the Swagger documentation.
   ```typescript
   import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';

   // ... other imports ...

   const options = new DocumentBuilder()
     .setTitle('Iluvcoffee')
     .setDescription('Coffee application')
     .setVersion('1.0')
     .build();

   const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
   SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);
   ```

3. **View the API Documentation**:
   Once your application is running (use `npm run start:dev` if it's not), you can view the Swagger UI at:
   [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)
